In order to build the GMS sources, make sure you have a recent version of Ant in your path. 
In the current directory. i.e shoal/gms, execute the following :

ant or ant all 
to delete existing built classes and jars and to build sources and assemble jars

ant clean 
to only clean the built classes and assembled jars

ant compile 
to only compile sources and place built classes in the build directory

ant assemble
to only build jar from already built sources. The built jar "shoal-gms.jar" is placed in dist directory.

**********

Developer level test

Run following command:
% runsimulatecluster.sh <transport>

<transport> can be grizzly, jxtanew or jxta.   grizzly is the default for this script.

After the run has completed, run following command. 
% analyzelogs.sh

The output shows all JOINED, JOINED_AND_READY and PLANNED_SHUTDOWN events recevied by Master server and then each member of 10 instance cluster.
