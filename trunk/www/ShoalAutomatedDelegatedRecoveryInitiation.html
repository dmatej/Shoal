<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Shoal Automated
Delegated Recovery Initiation</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">To better understand this document,
read : </FONT><A HREF="ShoalDesignDocument.html"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Shoal
Design Document</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Shoal's GroupManagementService
(GMS) provides a client API that allows client components within a
process to receive callbacks when group events occur. One such group
event is the Automatic Selection of a live member for Initiating
Recovery operations on a failed member's resources when the failure
is confirmed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This selection event is only
notified to the registered component on the selected member, while a
record of this selection is shared with all members through an entry
in the GMS implementation of Distributed State Cache.&nbsp; In order
to have such a selection performed and notification delivered, one or
more components in each member should register with the Group
Management Service.&nbsp; For this, the client component has to
implement two interfaces, namely, FailureRecoveryActionFactory and
FailureRecoveryAction.&nbsp; FailureRecoveryActionFactory produces a
FailureRecoveryAction which consumes a FailureRecoverySignal, which
is the selection event object handed by GMS on the member that is
selected. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The client invokes the registration
API by doing the following :</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="courier new">GroupManagementService gms =
GMSFactory.getGMSModule(groupName);<BR>gms.addActionFactory(FailureRecoveryActionFactory);<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">When
Failure Occurs</FONT></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">GMS's
failure handing core would determine if the recovery member selection
algorithm needs to be run and if there are recipients for such a
resultant notification. If so, the algorithm is run and in the member
that was selected, the client component's
<FONT FACE="courier new">FailureRecoveryActionFactory's
produceAction()</FONT> method is invoked, followed by invoking the
produced <FONT FACE="courier new">FailureRecoveryAction</FONT>'s
<FONT FACE="courier new">consumeSignal()</FONT> method. GMS passes
the <FONT FACE="courier new">FailureRecoverySignal</FONT>
implementation packaging the failed member's identity token,
timestamps, etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The recovery selection algorithm
currently depends on an identically ordered list of members on all
surviving members. The list prior to failure is consulted, and the
member that was next in the list to the failed member, is selected
for recovery operations. This makes it a more deterministic, simple
bit scalable solution for recovery operations. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Note that the implementation of
<FONT FACE="courier new">FailureRecoveryAction</FONT>'s
<FONT FACE="courier new">consumeSignal()</FONT> method has to follow
the precedence norms set out in the <A HREF="ShoalDesignDocument.html">Shoal
Design Document</A>. In other words, the implementation in
<FONT FACE="Courier New">consumeSignal()</FONT> method should first
acquire the Signal by invoking <FONT FACE="Courier New">FailureRecoverySignal.acquire()</FONT>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Note also that the <FONT FACE="Courier New">acquire()</FONT>
call here has special meaning in that Shoal's protective Failure
Fencing kicks in when this call is made, i.e. internally, the
Distributed State Cache implementation is called and an entry is
placed in it recording the recovery member identity, the failed
member identity, the recovery state (appointed or in-progress) and a
timestamp of the entry. Once recovery is completed, the
<FONT FACE="Courier New">consumeSignal() </FONT>implementation should
call <FONT FACE="Courier New">Signal.release() </FONT>which results
in the fence being lowered . i.e. the entry in the Distributed State
Cache is removed. </FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">When
a remote/delegate member is performing recovery operations on a
failed member's resources, this operation has to be protected from
contention or race conditions. The contention or race condition could
occur when the failed member restarts before the recovery operations
by the delegate member is completed and attempts to regain control of
its resources. In order to enforce such a protection, GMS provides a
protocol that allows processes to raise a protective fence until
recovery operations are complete, at which point, the fence is
lowered by the recovery member. The lowering of the fence is
automatically done when <FONT FACE="Courier New">consumeSignal()</FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">implementation
calls <FONT FACE="Courier New">FailureRecoverySignal.release()</FONT>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">When
a failed member restarts, the protocol requires that the member check
with the group as to whether any other member is performing recovery
operations on its resources. This portion of the protocol is termed
<B>Netiquette</B>. This is provided through <FONT FACE="Courier New">GroupHandle.isFenced()
</FONT>API. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
client in the restarting failed member, may have predetermined
policies for handling such situations. One policy example could be to
continue its startup without reclaiming control over the resources,
and reclaim ownership when notified about completion of the recovery.
GMS currently does not provide notifications when the fence is raised
or lowered. Typically, clients can call the <FONT FACE="Courier New">GroupHandle.isFenced()</FONT>
API to make such a determination. Another policy example would be to
block start up until the recovery operations are completed and
continue startup after regaining control of resources. This is left
to the client's implementation. </FONT>
